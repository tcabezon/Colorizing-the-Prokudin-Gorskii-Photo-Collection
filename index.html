                Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin-Gorsky was a chemist and photographer of the Russian Empire. He is best
                known
                for his pioneering work in color photography and his effort to document early 20th-century Russia. In
                imitation to the way the human eye senses color, in his pothograps the visible spectrum of colors was
                divided into three channels of information by capturing it in the form of three black-and-white
                photographs,
                one taken through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter.

            <div class="row">
                <img src="data/graph1.png" class='col-sm-10 d-block float-top mx-auto d-block img-fluid col-12'>

                Those original negative images (available in the Library of Congress) are going to be used in this
                assignment to compose the color photographs. Due to the way the images were captured using three
                different
                cameras, as it can be seen in the image above, the negatives are not aligned. Therefore, to generate the
                RGB
                images, these negatives first need to be preprocessed.

            <div class="container col-lg-10 col-12 ">
                <div class="row p-0 m-0 ">
                    <div class="col-md-6 ">

                    <div class="col-md-6 align-self-center">

            <p>
                To generate the final image, we need to divide the initial image into red, green, and blue channels.
                Actually, the original glass negatives are ordered in blue, green, and red order from top to bottom
                Then, as
                we can see in the gif image, we have to find the correct alignment of the three taking one of them as
                the
                base, in our case the blue channel. Once the alignment is found, we can combine the three channels.
            </p>
            <h3>Search Methods</h3>
            <p>
                As matching criteria, two different metrics have been considered, the Sum of the Square Differences
                (SSD)
                and the normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC):

                The Sum of Squared Differences is calculated based on the following equation

                where <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> are both of the arrays we are comparing and <i>h,w</i> the corresponding
                pixels
                at a given height and width. The best alignment will be the one with the lower NCC value, this is


                The Normalized Cross-Correlation is calculated based on the following equation where as the name
                suggests,
                both of the arrays are first normalized<i>​​&mu;F</i> and <i>​​&mu;G</i> are the average of <i>F</i> and
                <i>G</i> respectively. The bestalignment will be the one with the highest value
            </p>

            <h3>Image Pyramid</h3>

            <p>
                For higher dimension images, the previous brute force approach is not feasible, as the number of
                possible alignment combinations increases, which is translated in a higher computation time. For
                those images, the pyramid algorithm is used. This algorithm consists in creating a multi-scale
                representation of the image. On each level the image is reduced by half, to do so, previous two the
                downsampling, a Gaussian filter is applied to prevent wrong aliasing in the process. In my case, I
                have downsampled the images until reached a dimension similar to the cathedral image, where we have
                seen that the initial search on a 15x15 grid is feasible.

                The search for the correct alignment is started with this smaller dimension of the image and then is
                translated to higher dimensions. Every time we look for the correct alignment on a higher dimension
                image, the previous displacement is taken into account and a new 3x3 displacement grid is
                considered.
            </p>

            <h3>Automatic cropping</h3>

            <p>

                Due to the alignment process, we can see that the borders of the resulting photographs have strange
                colors due to the three channels displacement and the black and white borders of the original glass
                negatives. To find those borders a Sobel filter has been applied both vertically and horizontally.
                The absolute values of the outputs have been considered and then combined vertically and
                horizontally to find the respective borders.
            </p>

            <h3>Gradient for the alignment</h3>
            <p>
                Some of the images, such as the emir or the village images, may be more difficult to align. This is
                because our alignment metric is based on the pixel values of the three images, however, this may not
                be a good approach as the pixel values may vary a lot in the different channels, as it is the case
                of the emir’s clothing, that is blue, so it will have higher pixel values in that channel but not in
                the others. In that case, we can use the same search metric but instead of using the pixel values,
                we could use other image features, as it can be the gradient to find the best alignment.
            </p>

            <h3>Automatic contrast</h3>

            <p>
                Sigmoid function has been used to apply automatic contrast to the image and improve the perception
                of it.
